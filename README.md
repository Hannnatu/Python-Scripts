Fortune Cookie Script (fcookie.py)
Overview
The fcookie.py script is a simple and fun Python program that generates a random fortune message based on user input. Whether you're looking for inspiration, guidance, or just a bit of fun, this script provides a personalized "fortune cookie" message to brighten your day!

How It Works
The script prompts the user to input one word related to the type of fortune they'd like to receive (e.g., love, money, happiness, success, or friendship).
Based on the input, the script selects a random message from a predefined set of fortunes.
If the input word doesn't match any of the predefined categories, the script will provide a default fortune message.

Converter Script (Script.py)
This script takes input in days and converts it to hours.
